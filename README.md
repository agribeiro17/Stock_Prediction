# Optiver - Trading At The Close


**Optiver - Trading At The Close** is a project consisting of multiple machine learning models designed to forecast the closing price movements of hundreds of NASDAQ-listed stocks. The idea for this project was inspired by a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/optiver-trading-at-the-close).

The main goal was not to participate in the competition itself, but to apply and implement machine learning methods learned in class to address a real-world forecasting problem.

The four models developed and evaluated in this project were: **LSTM, KNN, Linear Regression, and Random Forest.**

This work was part of the **Machine Learning (APC)** course in the **Masterâ€™s program in Electrical and Computer Engineering**  at [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=558417). The project was completed on **December 3, 2023**.


This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Machine Learning, covering both theoretical foundations and practical applications through hands-on projects. Students learn to design, implement, and evaluate learning models while developing teamwork, analytical thinking, and self-directed learning skills.
